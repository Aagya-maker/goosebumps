                Goosebumps is a series of horror novels written by American
                author R. L. Stine. The protagonists in these stories are teens
                or pre-teens who find themselves in frightening circumstances,
                often involving the supernatural, the paranormal, or the occult.
                Between 1992 and 1997, 62 books were published under the
                Goosebumps umbrella title. R. L. Stine also wrote various
                spin-off series, including, Goosebumps Series 2000, Give
                Yourself Goosebumps, Tales to Give You Goosebumps, Goosebumps
                Triple Header, Goosebumps HorrorLand, Goosebumps Most Wanted and
                Goosebumps SlappyWorld. Additionally there was a series called
                Goosebumps Gold that was never released.{' '}

                The Goosebumps series falls under many genres but mainly horror
                and thriller, although Stine characterizes the series as scary
                books that are also funny. Each book features different child
                characters and settings. The primary protagonists are middle
                class and can be either male or female. In Goosebumps stories,
                the central characters are often placed in remote or isolated
                locations, diverging from common societal conventions. This can
                range anywhere from comfortable suburban areas to boarding
                schools, foreign villages or campsites. Books typically feature
                characters who either recently moved to a new neighborhood or
                are sent to stay with relatives. The books in the Goosebumps
                series feature similar plot structures with children being
                involved in scary situations.At his peak, Stine was known to
                complete these stories extremely quickly, some of which were
                written in only six days. The books are mostly written in first
                person narrative, often concluding with twist endings. They
                contain surreal horror, with characters encountering the strange
                and supernatural. The author has plot devices he follows
                throughout his Goosebumps books. Stine says he does not have any
                death in his stories, and the children in his novels are never
                put into situations that would be considered too serious. He
                attributed the success of his books to their absence of drugs,
                depravity and violence. All Goosebumps books are written at a
                reading level ranging from 3rd to 7th grade.

                According to the documentary Tales from the Crypt: From Comic
                Books to Television, R.L. Stine said that he remembered reading
                the popular/infamous Tales from the Crypt comic books when he
                was young and credited as one of his inspirations. Books and
                characters in the series were inspired by books and films. For
                example, the character Slappy the Dummy was inspired by the
                literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's
                ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea
                for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a
                Halloween mask he had trouble getting off.Stine also uses his
                childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said,
                "Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can
                remember what it feels like to be afraid and panicky". Stine
                states he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets
                the title lead him to a story. Two common themes in the series
                are children triumphing over evil and children facing horrid or
                frightening situations and using their own wit and imagination
                to escape them. Stine does not attempt to incorporate moral
                lessons into his novels, and says his books are "strictly
                reading motivation".

                Following the success of Stine's young adult horror novels, the
                co-founder of Parachute Press the company that developed the
                series, Joan Waricha, persuaded him to write scary books for
                younger children. Stine says the name for the book series came
                to him after he saw a TV station's ad in TV Guide that stated
                "It's goosebumps week on Channel 11". He originally signed a
                six-book deal with the publisher Scholastic, but went on to
                write 62 books in the original series, the first book being
                Welcome to Dead House, released in July 1992. The series was
                originally aimed at girls, but both boys and girls enjoyed the
                series equally with half of Stine's fan mail being sent from
                boys.The cover illustrations for this series was done primarily
                by Tim Jacobus. Thirty-two of the books from the original series
                were later re-released with new artwork under the Classic
                Goosebumps rename.

                The books in the Tales to Give You Goosebumps and Goosebumps
                Triple Header series were written as short story anthologies,
                featuring a collection of stories in each book.From 1994 to
                1997, six Tales to Give You Goosebumps books were published. Two
                Goosebumps Triple Header books were released from 1997 to 1998,
                beginning with Three Shocking Tales of Terror: Book 1. Fifty
                Give Yourself Goosebumps books were published from 1995 to 2000,
                starting with Escape from the Carnival of Horrors. The books in
                this series were written as gamebooks, featuring multiple
                endings. The books in this series were ghostwritten by several
                authors, including Kathryn Lance and Stine's sister-in-law Megan
                Stine. Many of the cover illustrations for this series were done
                by Mark Nagata. Due to declining Goosebumps sales and increasing
                competition (primarily from another series from Scholastic,
                Animorphs), Scholastic and R. L. Stine decided to create
                Goosebumps Series 2000.[40] From 1998 to 2000, 25 books in the
                series were published, beginning with Cry of the Cat. The books
                in this series were written in a similar format and featured
                similar content to the original series,but Stine classified them
                as being "much scarier." The covers in this series were
                illustrated by Tim Jacobus. The books in the Goosebumps Gold
                series appeared on illustrator Tim Jacobus's website and
                marketing sites but were never released. In this series, Stine
                intended to write a sequel to The Haunted Mask II (The Haunted
                Mask Lives!), and a sequel to Welcome to Dead House (Happy
                Holidays from Dead House). It was one of the two-book series by
                Stine that was planned to be released in 2000 (the other was The
                Nightmare Room) The series was renewed in 2008 following the
                release of the first book in the Goosebumps HorrorLand series,
                Revenge of the Living Dummy, that was published on April 1,
                2008. Before the 2008 release of Revenge of the Living Dummy,
                there had not been a Goosebumps book published in almost 10
                years. Stine decided to start writing Goosebumps books again
                after receiving mail asking him to write new books in the
                series. Nineteen Goosebumps HorrorLand books were published, and
                books in the series mainly featured two stories. The series
                continued in 2012 with new stories featuring some of the series'
                most memorable villains, including Slappy the Dummy, the Lawn
                Gnomes and others. The first book of the spin-off series
                Goosebumps Most Wanted, Planet of the Lawn Gnomes, was released
                in October 2012.

                Following the release of the first novel in the series, the
                books quickly became popular, selling a million copies a month
                soon after they first appeared,[6] and four million copies a
                month by the mid-1990s. Individual Goosebumps books appeared in
                the New York Times Best Seller list for children and the USA
                Today bestseller list. In 2001, Publishers Weekly listed 46
                books in the series in its list of bestselling children's
                paperback books of all time. Goosebumps was a bestseller in many
                countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom,
                France, and Australia. In 1996, the book series accounted for
                almost 15% of Scholastic's annual revenue. Following the decline
                of Goosebumps sales next year, Scholastic's sales had dropped
                40%. The decline in Goosebumps book sales had made front-page
                news of most newspaper business sections, which Patrick Jones
                stated "demonstrates the impact and importance of R. L. Stine.
                One writer, it seems, influences the fate of an entire company".
                As of 2008, the Goosebumps series maintains an 82% brand
                awareness among children 7–12. It is listed as the number two
                bestselling children's book series of all time and as
                Scholastic's bestselling children's book series of all time. By
                2014, according to Scholastic, there were 350 million copies of
                Goosebumps books sold in 32 languages, including Chinese, Czech,
                Spanish, and Hebrew.As of 2008, the book series sells about two
                million copies annually. Three books from the Goosebumps series
                have won the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Book:
                Deep Trouble in 1995 (the award category's first year), the book
                Tales to Give You Goosebumps in 1996, and Deep Trouble II in
                1998. In 2000, the series was ranked as the number two
                children's books by the National Education Association, as
                chosen by children. In 2003 Goosebumps was listed at number 188
                on the BBC's The Big Read poll of the UK's 200 "best-loved
                novels."

                Upon the release of the first book, Welcome to Dead House,
                Goosebumps received critical acclaim with many critics and
                readers praising the series for its dark nature, villains,
                likable protagonists and for being much more mature compared to
                other children's book series at the time. Slate's Katy Waldman
                classified a classic Goosebumps story as "funny, icky, and just
                a bit menacing". Following the release of the first Goosebumps
                HorrorLand book, Publishers Weekly stated in a starred review
                that the new Goosebumps series was "deliciously chilling" Two
                reviewers of the Goosebumps books did not feel that the books
                were high quality literature. U.S. News & World Report's Marc
                Silver thought the series was "quite tame". He called the
                Goosebumps books "subliterature", stating the plotting in the
                books was careless and that characters in the stories rarely
                grew. Roderick McGillis, from the academic journal Bookbird,
                described the books as camp, writing the books "are so
                artificial, so formulaic, so predictable, so repetitive".
                McGillis also felt that the content of the Goosebumps series is
                "thin in the extreme". Stine's books have a reputation for
                getting children excited about reading, which the writer is very
                proud of. James Carter, writing in Talking Books: Children's
                Authors Talk About the Craft, Creativity and Process of Writing,
                stated "regarding Point Horrors and Goosebumps, I feel that
                anything that children read avidly is a good thing". Librarian
                and writer Patrick Jones commented that "the real horror is a
                culture where kids, especially boys, don't read—and Stine has
                done his best to stop that turn of the screw from happening in
                his lifetime".
